config PCD8544_TRANS_QUEUE_SIZE
    int "Data transfer queue size"
        range 1 255
	default 32
	help
		Internal queue size for asynchronous SPI transmission.
                Optimal value depends on if you will use a DMA channel for PCD8544 or not.

                If you use DMA, you will get less CPU usage and low latency. You can set lesser value
                like 32 for less memory overhead.
                If you do not use DMA, and you got warning from serial log, higher value like 96 will be
                optimal for lesser CPU load.

                iF you encountered stop, queue is full.

config PCD8544_BIAS_SYSTEM
    int "Bias system"
        range 0 7
	default 7
	help
		Internal parameter of base of LCD contrast range.

                Tune this parameter when your PCD8544 have too low contrast, It can be confirmed
                by segments are all ON or all OFF. For more detail, read PCD8544 datasheet.

config PCD8544_TEMPERATURE_COEFFICIENT
    int "Temperature coefficient"
        range 0 3
	default 2
	help
		Internal parameter for V_LCD Voltage curve for optimize PCD8544 LCD.

                Tune this parameter when you feel the contrast of LCD is uncontrollable
                especially in low temperature environment. For more detail, read PCD8544 datasheet.
